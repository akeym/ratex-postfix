Show Postfix queue data on a Ratex currency exchange rate display.

notes:
- Baud rate defaults to 300
- Battery holds RTC data, display data and settings.. if its dead, must be configured each time
- Serial port is basically just another way to send commands like the IR remote does
- Display row/column numbers may not match actual physical layout!
- Display has small serial buffer, so data must be rate limited
